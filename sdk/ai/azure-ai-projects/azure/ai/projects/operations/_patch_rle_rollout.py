"""Shared request/response plumbing for the RLE Execute Rollout operation.

The sync and async operation groups differ only in how they await the pipeline and the
credential, so everything else -- URL construction, body shaping, error surfacing -- lives here
and is used by both. Keeping it in one place is what stops the two surfaces from drifting into
sending subtly different requests.
