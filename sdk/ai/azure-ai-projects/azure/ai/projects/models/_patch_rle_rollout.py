"""Models for the RLE Execute Rollout operation.

Execute Rollout runs one complete episode of a published RLE environment version and returns
what it produced. The service owns the loop -- it resets the environment, asks the model for a
completion, applies the action, and repeats until the environment terminates or the version's
step budget is spent. The caller supplies only the task and the model binding.

That is the difference from the instance-level reset/step operations, where the caller owns the
loop and drives an instance it leased. Here nothing is leased and nothing is stepped by hand; a
rollout is one request and one result.

The result carries both halves of what a training run needs: ``reward`` (and ``success`` where a
grader produced a verdict) and ``rollout``, the Capture Proxy graph, whose ``sequences`` hold the
``input_ids``/``loss_mask``/``logprobs`` of every model turn the episode sampled.
